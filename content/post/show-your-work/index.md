# My Main Takeaways

“If *Steal Like an Artist* was a book about stealing influence from other people, this book is about how to influence others by letting them steal from *you.*”

# My Notes

“In order to be found, you have to be findable”

Networking is a waste of time unless you actually *take advantage* of your network.

Build sharing *into* your routine

By building sharing into your routine, you immediately begin to attract a group of like-minded people

- And although they may be likeminded, they will offer you help and criticism, all while being engaged in the work you share

“Give what you have. To someone, it may be better than you dare to think.” - Henry Wadsworth Longfellow

The “lone genuis” myth. It created this idea of creativity as an *antisocial* act, delimited to those the likes of Mozart, Einstein, Picasso, Tesla

The idea of the scenius: ideas are not born in an echo chamber, even the greats had people to support them, creativity is born *in tandem* with collaboration.

Contributing to the scenius does not require extreme “talent” or “intellect” all it takes is a contribution. It opens the story of creativity for the rest of us

- Now (because of the internet) is the easiest time to join a scenius

The amateur that pursues their interest regardless of potential for fame, “in the spirit of love,” has more advantages long term over the expert.

“Amateurs know that contributing something is better than contributing nothing”

The work of amateurs is just that of someone who is tremendously inexperienced, but tremendously willing to learn.

The difficulties and struggles an amateur overcame were recent in comparison to the expert, thus, amateurs are often more suited to help others.

*Even experts need an amateur’s spirit*, embrace uncertainty

Look for gaps in other people’s research, and *fill it.*

Finding your voice is the result of using it.

Case of Roger Ebert - Share your thoughts online, otherwise no one will hear them, and then your voice will be born

---

A hard fact to accept, but one we must all recognize: we are all going to die. 

Understand that every day is a gift, don’t sit around and wait for things to happen. The sooner *you make them happen,* the sooner *they will happen.* 

Reading obituaries as a means to remember the beauty of life, and how important it is to take action, what do you want your obituary to look like?

“Thinking about death every morning makes me want to live”

Theres a difference between the *artwork* and the *art work.* 

There is a prevailing myth that an artist should keep their process locked away in a box with a key. That to all the general public, what matters is only the finished artwork, a piece of magnificence that came out of pure genius. That she, the artist, should wait for her artwork to be finished before it is shared with her audience.

- This was certainly true of a non digital age, the vulnerability of art making was never shared because galleries and whatnot were far more competitive

- That isn’t the case today, because now, all stages of the art making process can be shared.

*Process is Messy*

Share the process with those around you, audiences are actually really interested in the process that is behind a great (or not-so-great) piece of work. Why? because it allows them to be a part of the product, by witnessing the person who created the product

“people really do want to see how the sausage gets made”

---

*Become a Documentarian*

Chris Hadfield became the first media sensation of an astronaut because he was the first to document every step of the astronauts life. Basically: *show your work.* 

We feel as though we don’t have much to show for our work, but maybe the apprentice’s work is *more* valuable?

Turn  the bits and pieces of your work ethic into interesting bits of media that you can share. 

“No one is going to give a damn about your resume; they want to see what you have made with your own little fingers.” David Carr

Keep track of what you do, blog, journal, vlog, whatever, just put it down somewhere. It isn’t about making art, its about keeping track.

Whether or not you share it, you *will* start to feel the fruits of your labor. And when you are ready to share, you’ll have a surplus to choose from. 

*Share something small every day.* it’ll lead to something big

---

*Send out a Daily Dispatch*

Long Term Success™ is just that, long term. But seeing too far ahead can fog your mind and overwhelm you. Choose a unit of time that makes you comfortable, and start from there.

Think about units of time. Some are man made, like the week/month, but some, like the day, are easy to handle. Think about what you did that day, and document it. As big as a finished project, as small as a phrase of inspiration. The means also doesn’t matter. It can be an email, tweet, IG post, youtube vid, etc. What matters is the documentation. 

This “daily dispatch” is arguably better than a resume or portfolio, because it tells others about us in the *present moment*.

Don’t be afraid to jump on some random platform, people hang out in strange places. And if you don’t like it, leave! The beauty of this world is that nobody really cares, so feel free to experiment. 

When choosing what to post, stick to the question: *What are you working on?*

- “Don’t post you lunch or latte; show your work.”

Don’t worry about being perfect, Theodore Sturgeon once said 90% of everything is crap.

We are all busy, but we all get 24 hours a day. So how do we find the time?

- The same way we find spare change, in the nooks and crannies

- But still prioritize, don’t let sharing your work take too much precedence over actually working.

*The “so what” test*

The “warning” chapter of the book

Be careful what you post online, “post as though everyone who can read it has the power to fire you.” Don’t post things you aren’t ready for everyone in the world to see.

There is a big difference between sharing, and oversharing

Sharing is done out of generosity, you *want* your work to be shared. So be careful with what you share.

Ask yourself, “so what” every time you post some piece of work. Don’t overthink it either, go with your gut.

It’s okay to let something dwell as a draft for further review, you’ll be glad you did.

![Screen_Shot_2022-10-03_at_2.37.37_PM.png](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/f83eb76c-b555-4015-8ae9-6aa3f1a2307e/Screen_Shot_2022-10-03_at_2.37.37_PM.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20221022%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20221022T093002Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=46cc092c49a8d4faf1fd114870f9c2395e745f05c4d55ca8a5b741ff7ddd810a&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)

*I would note:* Change “is it useful or interesting?” too “Can it be useful or interesting?” Is it interesting, is a bit too decisive of a question. We have to be forward looking in our analysis of our work.

---

*Turn Your Flow Into Stock.*

Difference between *stock* and *flow.* 

Flow is the daily stuff. Flow are the updates that “remind people you exist.” 

Stock is the content you produce that will be relevant down the line. Stock is what people discover, criticize, and cite.

So how do we build stock? We can organize and build on the bits and pieces that comprise our flow until it turns into durable stock. 

By posting on social media, you are building a notebook of ideas and patterns. Make sharing part of your daily routine and those small ideas, over time, can turn into big ones.

---

*Build a good (Domain) Name.*

Social networks are great, but they come and go. The best way to build an online presence is to *own* a space.

Begin building your website: Register a domain name, find a hosting platform, and build a website. [Most of these sound technical, but a few youtube videos, google searches, and blogs will have you on your way]

Doesn’t have to be pretty, just has to exist.

Don’t fall for the “shiny new social media platform” trap. Keep your website for the long term, update it, make it look clean, but most importantly- put yourself out there on it. Online, you can be the person you really want.

“*And if you can build a good name, eventually that name will be its own currency.”*

Do your thing, so when they’re ready to see it one day, you’re ready for them.

---

*Don’t be a Hoarder*

In 16th / 17th century Europe, people had *Wunderkammern,* A wonder chamber to fill the things you owned, kind of like a modern day museum.

Take note of your influences. Whether you like it or not, the work you produce is inherently an amalgamation of the work of hundreds before you.

After you realize your influences, share them. They give others a clue as to who you are and the type of work that you hope to create. 

When you first create things, they wont be that good, “but your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer”

Your influences are worth sharing as well.

---

*No Guilty Pleasures*

“Dumpster diving” is one of the jobs of the artist

To find gold, you must search for it. Look through the bits and pieces that everyone else is ignoring. Pay attention to it, comment on it. Be willing to search for inspiration in places other people aren’t willing or able to go.

Don’t be ashamed for liking “garbage.” Everyone will always have their guilty pleasures, but that’s what makes us unique. Have the courage to keep loving your garbage.

Don’t try to be hip or cool. Be open and honest about the things you like, that’s what makes you you. And don’t let anyone else shame you for liking the things you do. 

---

*Credit is Always Due*

Always attribute the original creator of a cited work. This is always going to be extremely important, not just in the upper echelons of academia. 

But don’t just share the author. Share the how, when, why, where, etc. of the work you find.
