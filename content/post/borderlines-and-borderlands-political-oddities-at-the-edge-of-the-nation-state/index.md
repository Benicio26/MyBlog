**Introduction: See Notability notes on Gibraltar**

**Chapter 1: The Border Enclaves of India and Bangladesh**

There are 198 enclaves in the Northern border between India and Bangladesh. For the most part, residents of either side aren’t really aware of these enclaves. Mostly because of a lack of border control or fencing. The enclaves kind of just exist. The only exception to this really is the Dahagram-Angarpota enclave, of which Bangladesh has maintained recognized? sovereignty.

The problem is that these enclaves do not belong to Bangladeshi, nor do they belong to India. And as such, they are protected nor provided to by either country. They don’t identify with either, simply *Chitmahal Bashi* [enclave people]

*Origins of the Enclaves*

The enclaves were caused by an incompatability with the feudal-based mahajaras and territorially-defined state sovereignty of the british. 

After a long war between majaraja of Cooch Behar and the Mogul Rulers resulted in an agreement that established the enclaves. The treaty had it so that whatever army occupied a particular region, that army’s ruler would aquire that land. This really only affected what taxes residences people had to pay, for th most part, they could move in and out of the enclaves freely.

This treaty was signed in 1713. So once the british arrived in India in the mid 18th century, they actually respected the existing treaties as they desired to maintain friendly relations with the Cooch Behar, who were in a geographically advantageous position.

…

The people in these enclaves have been systematically neglected, something that should be stopped as soon as possible. The boundary oddity in quesiton is one that can be easily resolved. All it would take is the respective host countries to accept the enclaves as their own. Both countries would have to do so, meaning no additional disputes need be fought. These enclaves aren’t pivotal territory and provide no strategic advantage to either country. 

Accepting the eclaves would simply normalize the defacto situation. In fact, Bangladesh and India have agreed to this over 35 years ago, but neither country has followed up on providing services to these enclaves.

**Chapter 2: The Uzbekistan-Kyrgyzstan Boundary**

One of the oddest border disputes in the world, the post soviet Ferghana Valley space poses an extremely interesting example of how important borders are to sovereignty. 

The valley is home to seven internationally recognized enclaves, and two of the worlds largest, Sokh and Vorukh

The border between Uzbekistan and kyrgyztan in the Ferghana Valley is extremely important. It cuts of villages and neighbors, transports illegal drugs, and was crucial to the dramatic overthrow of Kyrgyzstani President Askar Akaev in 2005

*Origins of the boundary*

Pre-soviet Political Geography

In a pre-soviet era, the Valley was extremely diversified. The groups of people living there were identified by languagem village, religion, kin group, and other small allegiances. Uzbek, Kyrgyz, and Tajik were used as much broader terms. This is because the valley was conquered by the Greeks, Arabs, Mongols, and Turks, numerous times.

And so, the multiethnic makeup of the region was incompatible with the new state political borders.

By the mid19th century, a series of regional dynasties ruled the valley and steppe. The Khoqand dynasty ruled the valley directly. These dynasties were also not ethnic, and sustained legitimacy through personal loyalty.

As was during the age of imperialism in the late 19th century, russia followed suite with her imperialist brothers and decided to conquer the caucuses. The conquest of Tashkent in 1865, Bukharans and Khivans in 1868 & 1873, annexation of Khoqand in 1876, and finally the triumph over Turkmen resistance in 1881. The kazakh nomad territory became the Governate General of the Steppe. The southern territories became the Governate General of Turkestan, and the Khivan Khanate & Bukharan Emirate became autonomous vassals.

The Bolshevik Revolution

In the period from 1916 - 1920, there was a lot of political strife in the region. By 1924, Bolshevik control was firmly established in the region. With this came a mass amount of geopolitical restructuring in the region of Turkestan, and the previous empires ceased to exist as their previous forms.

National Territorial Delimitation (NTD)

In the Politubro of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party in 1920, Stalin’s concept of divided states in the caucuses was discussed. Some worried that these new states would push propoganda against the Bolsheviks.

The USSR was formed in 1922, this new system developed a framework, paradoxical at best, that provided a “national unity” in the pretense of future equality. See, the idea was that over time, “nationality” would wither away, because it was inherently capitalist. But in the meantime, the USSR would embrace regional national identities. The idea was that the workers would eventually unite under a non-nationalist identity of the Union, but for now the USSR worked under “existing realities” and recognized national differences.

The new USSR provided a framework from which the NTD could finally be examined. And indeed it was, as a central asian committee was created to monitor and execute the delimitation of a new Uzbek & Turkmen, Tajik, Kyrgyz and Kazakh.
