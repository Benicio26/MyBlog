title: Why is America?

üí° This is a companion article to a video I soon hope to release which will be a far more visual look at these issues

Recently I took a week long trip to Tennessee for some family business. It was my second time in the American South (I‚Äôm well aware that the lot of you will get rather anal about my categorization of Tennessee as the American South. Frankly, I consider Tennessee to be the South, and anything below that to be the Deep South, with perhaps a slight exception for Florida, because Florida is Florida, and cannot be categorized.) and perhaps the most amount of time I spent in a car in years. Thus,I decided to write a lengthy ‚Äúreport‚Äù about my experience.

I should preface this by saying that this is a blog. It is not an academic study, nor should it be treated as such. My goal here is not to be a work of reference in a journal paper, but to bring light to an issue which I believe deserves far more attention than it has been allotted, and to do so in perhaps more digestible prose. 

The next preface I will give is in regards to the pre-existing community of city enthusiasts. Although I stated that the issue of car-dependency is one that deserves far greater urgency, I wholly acknowledge the community of like-minded fellows who have been fighting the fight for people-centered cities for years. A large thanks is forwarded to @notjustbikes on YouTube, who gave me a much needed synthesis on the many quarrels I have felt for years. 

The next preface I will give is a much-needed one. I spent lots of time in Europe, and a uncommon, but existing critique I will often get follows the tune of ‚ÄúIt is quite easy to criticize America repeatedly if you simply don‚Äôt like the country.‚Äù Although the problems I will address are all-encompassing, and many countries can easily have fingers pointed at, I would be lying if I said that this essay is not focused on the United States of America. Naturally and intentional, of course, as in every pile of critiques, therein lies an exemplar. The US provides the pinnacle of many issues I would like to talk about, but nor am I wholly unfaithful for the future. In summary, this essay is not meant to endlessly bash the US out of spite (I was born and raised there, for heaven‚Äôs sake). And as it turns out, I would actually quite like to see a brighter future for the US, and I intend on contributing to that future, if I may. 

The final preface this essay will get is in regards to length and content. I have had many thoughts brewing in the ol‚Äô thought-cauldron, and would like to get out as much of it as possible. As such, this essay will be divided into a multitude of sections. Although I believe each section is going to be worth the read, should you desire a more-analytical-less-anecdotal read, some sections can be understandably swept through (after this article is finished, return to identify those sections).

With all of that out of the way, lets hit the gas on this issue, shall we?

## From where? To where?

Counting my travels from New York to Tennessee

## The No-BS Account of Europe

One of the easiest ways for anyone to criticize the United States in their pedestrian infrastructure, and the ‚Äúfriendliness‚Äù of their cities is to look at the Europe. 

## America Now

## How did we get here?

## A way forward?
