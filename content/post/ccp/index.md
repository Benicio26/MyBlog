# Jared Diamond

> What are his theories, how did he aim to prove them, do I agree? Is Political geography the ultimate deciding factor?

My opinion on Guns, Germs, and Steel?

- Examples of UK & Japan, geographical similarities between them (and differences)

	- The UK and Japan share a pretty stunning geographical similarity, which, in my opinion, led them to be quite astray from each other for most of world history, but then be able to cement themselves, although in different times throughout history, as superpowers, driven out of necessity.

Reflections on Guns, Germs, and Steel

	- There is a trend amongst recent sociologists to overessentialize the ideational over the material, or blur the lines at least.

	- The problem with this theory is that it then assumes that humans can overcome these problems by simply technologically and culturally. 

	- And if they don’t evolve like we expect them to, they are seen as “backwards” or a “failed state”

	- But what truly leads to the failed state? Failed governance, sure. But can we dig deeper? Jared Diamond does just that. 

- Critics dismiss GGS for what they perceive as “Vulgar materialism, biological determinism, environmental reductionism/structuralism.” Call it what you will, the critic’s argument is that Diamond overly reduces what should be an extremely complex analysis of the development of Human history. However, Diamond’s work provides the foundation for a complex analysis of the bio geographical conception of history. Here I outline Diamond’s main theory: Differences amongst people over time resulted [mainly] from environmental differences among those people, and not biological differences of those people. 

- Whether or not you should label this as environmental essentialism is debatable. However, in light of modern science, what is not debatable is his second contention, that biological differences play no role in the varying developments of human history.

- Why did people of the Eurasian continent (mostly Europe) colonize the entire world? they were not biologically different than others based on their soil, which is what a marxist-lamarckian view would tell you. It came down mostly to the advantages given to those people through the available fauna and (domesticable-able) wildlife, thus fostering a growth in population, and a .

- Of the 56 known large-seemed grass species in the world, all of them prime candidates for staple crops, 32 are in the Mediterranean

- For example, wheat species of the Fertile Crescent were high in protein and far more domesticable (Harare might add a nuance) than per say, the maize of the America.

- Stopping at: Eurasia was also home…

- Because Eurasia has so many of these large domesticable species, it is certainly possible that Eurasians gained a lot of resistance to those diseases.

- Continental Axis theory: rThe east west orientation of the Eurasian continent made 

	- Why?

	- Because plants, animals, and ideas can be much easily transported across the Eurasian subcontinent.

<br/>

- Critiques of Jared Diamond:

- This isnt so much a critique as it is a critical addition to Diamond’s theory.

- [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:JARM.0000005510.54214.57](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:JARM.0000005510.54214.57)

	- This article provides that it is a bit of a simplification to divide ancient peoples along the lines of farmers and hunters. archeological evidence provides that humans did both, to varying degrees, in different times in history.

- It seems like a big critique of Jared Diamon’s theory of everything is that it simply does not account for the modern day, again, it is just too simple of an analysis. Jared Diamond’s approach to human development forming along the lines of domesticable food, animals, and favorable geography seems to broad an explanation for modern events. It can be pointed out as such, the fact that Europeans had better plants and animals simply does not explain why the Spanish conquered the Aztecs in 1500.

- Despite this however, I think that Jared diamond places an extremely solid foundation for analyzing courses of history. As civilzation progresses, and human interactions become more complex and complex trade gives people access to resources that give them an upperhand despite their geography, geography becomes more and more of a *driving,* not *deciding* factor, and is incredibly useful when looking at historical events. Diamond provides the example of the Maori Moriori conflict.

How did Jared Diamond romanticize nomadic life. 

# Early State Formation and Theories

> What are the characteristisc of an official state?

1. **Centralized hierarchical authority -* *Capable of enforcing rules

1. **Backed by legitimate power -* *No militias, general social consensus

1. **Territorial -* *A state cannot exist without land

1. **Stratified society -* *Emergence of slavery, absolute powerlessness, social classes

1. **Institutionalized religion -* *A priestly class; the custodians of religion’s belief

- Upper echelons set policy, lower ones have specific tasks.

- Little risk of insurrection

- Much larger territory.

<br/>

> **Chiefdom**

1. Leadership is traditional

1. decisions are efficient, but leadership is harder, requiring the mobilization of surplus resources. 

1. No more than 6 main cases (Indus River Valley, China, Mesopotamia, Peru, Mesoamerica, Egypt)

1. Authority cant be delegated in a chiefdom, and therefore they are generally smaller in size.

	1. Ruling territory limit: One half day of travel from chiefly center (25-30km) by foot.

<br/>

> Phases of societal development :

1. Early tribal egalitarianism

	1. Ephemeral leadership

	1. can be purely nomadic → purely sedentary.

1. Chiefdom

	1. As above

1. Primary state formation

	1. As above

<br/>

From here, early state formation theorists have given us several possible frameworks for explaining the emergence of the state.

- My personal favorite theory: Circumscription theory

	- Circumscription theory prescribes that initial “state” formation, as we see it today, was a process caused by the inherent Circumscription of a certain group. This is on a purely geographic basis as well. 

	- Carneiro – Circumscription theory contains three main aspects: envorinomental circumscription, population pressure, and warfare.

	- Examples: Peruvian civilization, Nile River civilization.

	- Counter examples: Amazonian tribes (sorta)

	- Why does Circumscription Theory work?

		- It works because being territorially circumscribed directly related to the amount of competition that occurs within a territory.

		- However, a better way to understand CT is to understand where it didn’t operate. In the amazon, tribes had access to plentiful lush resources, that were [relatively] evenly divided between a massive area. Competition amongst tribes was present, but not based on the acquisition of territory. Circumscription theory would have it that it is. because of this non-territorial based warfare that no state formation took place

		- In a circumscribed piece of land, competition fares on the basis of land acquisition, because land is a scarce resource.

		- Circumscription theory: the conflict elements

			- Potential outcomes of conflict:

			1. **RELOCATION* *– determined by environmental factors

			1. **INCORPORATION** – leads to hierarchy and likely subordination

			1. **ENSLAVEMENT –* *leads to further societal stratification

			1. **EXTERMINATION –* *complete annihilation of group/society

		- What came first? the war or the state? I believe war came first. Humans inherently drive towards conflict. a derivative of that disposition to conflict is the natural, reactionary collectivism based on mutual protection. 

	- Circumscription theory: challenges and responses

		- The main challenge is that places that seemed to not be candidates for primary state formation actually did develop some form of civilizations. For example: the amazonian tribes did actually develop some form of statehood, the reason for this being tha tland close to the amazon river was obviously high in demand. The further away you go the less desirable the land became. This created some competition, and thus, kind-of states.

- Territorial expansion is a feature of state development itself, not a result. States develop as a byproduct of territory expansion.

- There also arises an interesting question of how does territorial expansion theory and circumscription theory work in tandem?

<br/>

<br/>

- **Pristine theories (without coercion):**

	- **Population density**

		- Boserup: As populations grow so does their need to develop agriculture

		- Malthus: Methods of agricultural policy determine the size of one’s population.

		- I think they are both sort of right, but in terms of waht came first, I think it is fair to assume that agriculture was a driving force for population growth. However, archaic agriculture methods, whatever they may be, improper season prediction, incorrect plowing methods, etc. are only so viable for so long. Methods that require more strenuous labor techniques will eventually get more efficient, which ultimately leads to more crop yield and thus, more population.

	<br/>

	<br/>

	- Wittfogel’s Hydraulic theory as well

		- Hydraulic Theory - 	
• Irrigation / control over water
• Overcoming complex challenges -> Hierarchy

	**The Hydraulic theory** certainly is a viable one, teaching us a very important lesson on primary state formation, overcoming complex challenges → Hierarchy → development of monopolies over irrigation management. Thus, monopolies over division of labor. 

	Wittfogel cited the cases of ancient Egypt, China, India, and the Peruvian Empire, amongst others. 

	The main critique of Wittfogel’s theories, however, is the fact that in these regions, namely China, Mesopotamia, and Mesoamerica, full-fledged states developed far before large scale irrigation systems.



	**Automatic theories** assumed that with the invention of agriculture, humans acquired a surplus, which allowed for specializaiton. The problem with this theory is that not all agriculture leads to surplus. Although the theory itself leads to some important conclusions. This is because it is true that* suprlus *leads to stratification as people have more time to devote to their own activities without worrying about food surplus.

<br/>

**Coercive Theories:**

	Every stat has history of war, but not every war will ultimately lead to a state.

<br/>

> How does an early chiefdom become a state?

Maximum ruling distance: The amount that a chief can walk in a single day which determines their sovereignty distance.

- When authority gets delegated

- And why does authority get delegated?

	- Possible because war.

	- surplus resources outside of the existing domain needed to managed

	-

# Borders and Boundaries

### **Definitions -* *

**Delimitations:** To actually draw out the border, generally on a map. 

	Also, to *delimit* sovereignty

**Definition:** To purely state where the border is (not actually draw it out and finalize it yet)

**Demarcation:* *To physically, in the real world, mark down where the border is.

**Antecedent Boundary:** A border that was drawn without regard to the pre existing cutural divides.

	They may be *superimposed* and/or* consequential*

**Subsequent Boundary:** Borders that are drawn with regard to pre existing cultural boundaries

	May also be *superimposed* and/or *consequential*

**Superimposed Boundary:* *A border created by a 3d party.

	Papua New Guinea decided by the British and Dutch.

	India Pakistan - subsequent, consequential, and superimposed.

	African post colonial borders

**Consequential:* *A border that has very explicit consequences on the existing divides that preceded the border.

	Northern Ireland

	Post India-Pakistan demarcation, the muslim hindi neighborhoods got abandoned as people migrated to their new respective majority zones.

**Relic:* *When a border used to exist, but does not anymore. The division caused by the border is still very evident

	Poland A/B

	East-West Germany

	Fossa Regia in Tunisia

**State Boundaries**

**Natural:* *Boundaries that have developed because of a “natural” acquisition. States that are prospering have the natural obligation to expand, as if they are a living, breathing entity.

**National:** States expand because they feel a shared identity with the desired territory.

	Germany 

	Persian empire (Carthage)

**Contractual:** Borders that are created as a result of conflict resolution.

**Bufferzones:** State/zone that exists purely to be neutral and act as a mediator between two states. 

	DMZ bufferzone

	UN Buffer zone between Republic of Cyprus/ Northern Cyprus

**Borderzones:** Area in and around the border. 

**Divine / Physical:* *Borders marked by a physical geographic feature

	**Divine:** Physical borders that are seen as a holy delimitation of [holy] sovereign power.

**Geometric:** Borders drawn on lines of latitude and longitude.

	49th Parallel (US Canada)

	141º meridian of Papua New Guinea

**Cultural:** Boundaries that exist because of a pre existing cultural, social, linguistic, ethnic, divisions.

**Borders**: The delimitation of sovereignty [State]

**Boundary**: The cultural/ social division that may or may not be demarcated. [Nation]

**Partition:* *The process of dividing a state into two or more jurisdictional territories.

<br/>

> My opinion on a Borderless world?

The globalized world is ironically causing a more bordered world, as identities online become more polarized, so do border-based identities.

	- there may be significant territorial reconfiguration and re-territorialization, but the world is not becoming deterritorialized. Human activities still take place within well-defined borders, even within the sphere of capital and global markets. I take the example of the  stock market. The stock market is an incredible way to generate income and place your money in an account that allows it to preserve value at a greater rate than inflation. Another major benefit of the stock market, the ability to invest in foreign markets. If I wanted to invest in a foreign country’s markets, I very easily could. A global stock market leads way for foreign investments that allows people to support foreign entities from abroad. The most important note with this is that these investments happen under the pretense of states. The moment a state wants to enclose itself away from the global market, it has full authority to do so. Not to be naive of course, the chance of a state doing this is rare to none, because in joining a market they form a sort of reliance on that market. 

	- The point of this case study is to point out how even global exchanges happen within the confines of state power. States will try to increase their attractiveness on global markets through various means including better infrastructure, better human rights, self-investment, transparency, etc. 

	- **I then argue that it is perhaps a globalized ideal that increases state power. Why? because states are provided with an incentive to increase their effectiveness, diplomacy, transparency, conditions, and overall welfare.* *

	<br/>

	<br/>

	
◦ Whereas in the past, the main locus of political power rested with the state, it is now shared with non-state organizations and territories.
◦ People are still in borders, some of them well defined, lack territorial boundaries. And some are in more difficult to define in concrete terms. (Cultural)
• In Western discourse, boundary permeability and trans-boundary movement is seen as a means by which political rapprochement is achieved. Lines are important, but not as important.
◦ Because in the west, borders were pretty easily decided, demarcated along lines of sovereignty,
‣ Where they antecedent?
◦ But tell this new “borderless world concept” to Africa, where lines that were superimposed in complete disregard to localities are just starting to be cemented as delimits of state sovereignty.
• The fact that ethnic-territorial conflicts are widespread today is evidence for the importance of hard, territorial, dimensions of state power.

*Borders are reactionary. So a Borderless world cannot happen. Because humans are reactionary creatures. If I touch the stove accidentally and get burned, I will be more careful next time. The same is true of international relations.*

<br/>

**But is a borderless world one day possible?**

	I think so, I dont doubt the idea that a borderless world is possible. If we were to one day reach a global stage where international cooperative forces took over the weaker, individualist forces, we may very well reach a borderless world, but by pure coercion. I dont think a borderless world could ever happen by natural course. The world is so divided along ethnic and cultural lines, a derivative of the geography they live on, that I dont believe people will ever be willing to give up their sovereignty, because that means giving up a part of their identity in favor of a world that would blend those identities together.

	Again, a global world would happen under the pretense of a nation/ state defined system. I’d like to observe a simple case study that illustrates this point. 

	As a result of the Bolshevik revolution, a greater USSR was an ultimate goal. The ultimate goal was to have the works unite under a new nation, a nation that was not ethnic, religious, or linguistic, but united under a socialist future. Taking a look inside the USSR however, that reality posed its challenges.

	One of the oddest border disputes in the world, the post soviet Ferghana Valley space poses an extremely interesting example of how important borders are to sovereignty. 

	The valley is home to seven internationally recognized enclaves, and two of the worlds largest, Sokh and Vorukh.

	The border between Uzbekistan and kyrgyztan in the Ferghana Valley is extremely important. It cuts of villages and neighbors, transports illegal drugs, and was crucial to the dramatic overthrow of Kyrgyzstani President Askar Akaev in 2005

	In a pre-soviet era, the Valley was extremely diversified. The groups of people living there were identified by languagem village, religion, kin group, and other small allegiances. Uzbek, Kyrgyz, and Tajik were used as much broader terms. This is because the valley was conquered by the Greeks, Arabs, Mongols, and Turks, numerous times.

	And so, the multiethnic makeup of the region was incompatible with the new state political borders.

	By the mid19th century, a series of regional dynasties ruled the valley and steppe. The Khoqand dynasty ruled the valley directly. These dynasties were also not ethnic, and sustained legitimacy through personal loyalty.

	As was during the age of imperialism in the late 19th century, russia followed suite with her imperialist fellows to the west and decided to conquer the caucuses. The conquest of Tashkent in 1865, Bukharans and Khivans in 1868 & 1873, annexation of Khoqand in 1876, and finally the triumph over Turkmen resistance in 1881. The kazakh nomad territory became the Governate General of the Steppe. The southern territories became the Governate General of Turkestan, and the Khivan Khanate & Bukharan Emirate became autonomous vassals.

	The Bolshevik Revolution

	In the period from 1916 - 1920, there was a lot of political strife in the region. By 1924, Bolshevik control was firmly established in the region. With this came a mass amount of geopolitical restructuring in the region of Turkestan, and the previous empires ceased to exist as their previous forms.

	Then comes the National Territorial Delimitation (NTD).

	In the Politubro of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party in 1920, Stalin’s believed that the Caucuses needed to be divided in order to keep with the soviet ideal. Some worried that these new states would push propoganda against the Bolsheviks.

	The USSR was formed in 1922, this new system developed a framework, paradoxical at best, that provided a “national unity” in the pretense of future equality. See, the idea was that over time, “nationality” would wither away, because it was inherently capitalist. But in the meantime, the USSR would embrace regional national identities. The idea was that the workers would eventually unite under a non-nationalist identity of the Union, but for now the USSR worked under “existing realities” and recognized national differences.

	The new USSR provided a framework from which the NTD could finally be examined. And indeed it was, as a central asian committee was created to monitor and execute the delimitation of a new Uzbek & Turkmen, Tajik, Kyrgyz and Kazakh. The borders of which were based on skewed census data that forced locals to pick a “side” regardless of their vast ethnographic fluidity.

	Skipping ahead some time, directly after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the border between Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan was still very fluid. This is until 1993 when Uzbekistan began inflicting stricter border control to reduce Russian influence “leakage” from Kyrgyzstan. In 1999-2000, severe border conflicts between the two states began ramping up. Uzbekistan took an aggresive step when they errected a 2 meter tall barbed fence along their border, a physical demarcation that ended up being extremely consequential. 

	And so, The goal was an eventual united world, one in which borders meant zilch and people would unite under a common goal of harmony and socialism. The end result was a world in which the arbitrary borders that were drawn were simply too consequential on the people living there. As a result of a soviet united ideal, nationalism became the driving force of division.

<br/>

**Are borders a positive or negative thing?**

Both.

Positive:

	Borders instill a sense of unity in an archaic environment. As a derivative of my “borders are reactionary” argument, I make the contention that borders are a way for people to feel safe and guided. When hierarchal structures are formed, whatever the reason may be, humans like know where that structure is limited to. Ambiguity makes us feel uncomfortable. 

Negative:

	The problems with borders arise when borders take precedent over local identity. The need to draw borders often displaces people and is almost always heavily consequential. In fact, it is almost hard to think of a border dispute where a contractual border has not been consequential in some respect. 

<br/>

**Case studies & their lessons:* *Bir Tawil, Gibraltar, 198 India and Bangladesh Enclaves, Uzbekistan & Kyrgyzstan

Bir Tawil: An example of how post colonial border disputes can sometimes make no sense. But in reality, they kind of do make sense.

	Story:

		After the British had an effective hold on both modern egypt and modern sudan, they were trying to draw a border that would divide the two countries. In 1899 some guy in Lonon drew a border along the 22nd parallel. However, in classic british fashion, they realized their border didn’t make very much sense. So they redrew the border in 1902 with ehtnic majorities in mind. Bir Tawil had nomadic tribes that were ethnically egyptian and the halaib triangle had tribes that were ethnically sudanese. This didn’t matter much with the British having effective control of both territories anyway, until the 1950s. In a post british landscape, the Egyptians and Sudanese had to effectively choose between two arbitrary borders. The problem was that the Talaib triangle was much more desired than Bir Tawil (it had oil). Border options were split into two. Option 1 was the 22nd parallel which gave Bir tawil (ethnically Egyptian) to sudan and Halaib triangle (Ethnically Sudanese) to Egypt. Option 2 was the 1902 border that gave Bir Tawil to Egypt and Halaib triangle to Sudan. Neither country cared for Bir Tawil but both had reasons to want the Halaib triangle(it had oil). Thus the issues arise. Although Egypt invests in infrastructure in the Halaib triangle (as a result of Sudan “illegally” selling oil to the Canadians) which forced Sudan to leave Bir Tawil, Both states lay claim to the territory.

		And so why is Bir Tawil a random lawless land? Because the moment either state displays authority in Bir Tawil, they effectively agree to a border option and thus give up their claim to Halaib triangle.

	**Lesson to be Learned:**

		Bir Tawil excellently exemplifies how border disputes occur. It shows us how territory claims, especially in a post-colonial era, can spiral out of control and leave us with extreme oddities that only serve as leverage. Bir Tawil is simply an extreme, (and depending how you look at it, quite comedic) example amongst many that serve to show how borders can lead to disputes that from a modern lens, seem quite ridiculous, but have sufficient explanations from a historical lens. We learn from Bir Tawil that border disputes act as *leverage* and often times last forever, because the moment an actor acts on the border, they give up something else that contributes to their sovereignty.

Gibraltar:

198 India and Bangladesh Enclaves:

	**Story:**

		The story of the 198 Enclaves between India and the Northern Bangladesh border

		The modern complexities and inefficiences of the enclaves were caused by an incompatability with the feudal-based mahajaras and territorially-defined state sovereignty of the british. 

		After a long war between the feudal maharaja of Cooch Behar and the Mogul Rulers resulted in an agreement that established the enclaves. The treaty had it so that whatever army occupied a particular region, that army’s ruling nation would aquire that land. This treaty was signed in 1713. This treaty was quite odd, since it effectively created these obscure enclaves that were established as military exclaves. Bar from a sovereign state-based system, this really only affected what taxes residences people had to pay, for the most part, they could move in and out of the enclaves freely.

		So once the british arrived in India in the mid 18th century, they actually respected the existing treaties as they desired to maintain friendly relations with the Cooch Behar, who were in a geographically advantageous position, but the British also wanted to avoid excess military engagement as they had just defeated the Moguls in the region. 

		For the most part, residents of either side aren’t really aware of these enclaves. Mostly because of a lack of border control or fencing. The enclaves kind of just exist. The only exception to this really is the Dahagram-Angarpota enclave, of which Bangladesh has maintained recognized sovereignty and (some) border enforcement.

		The problem is that these enclaves do not belong to Bangladesh, nor were they effectively governed by India. And as such, they were protected nor provided to by either country. The people residing in these enclaves were protected by either state and existed in a sort of “nomans land.” They don’t identify with either, simply *Chitmahal Bashi* [enclave people]

		The deplorable conditions of the enclaves comes from the resulting neglect faced up until 2015. It should be noted that in 1974 a land boundary agreement was signed that would simplify the border and give the enclaves to the host countries. But neither country really went forward with this until the agreement was refined in 2015.

		Since this agreement, the only remaining enclave is an exclave of Bangladesh that exists in India, Dahagram-Angarpota.

	**Lessons to be Learned:**

		We learn an extremely important lesson on borders from this odd peculiarity of the borders between India and Bangladesh - that Border disputes have a tremendous effect on the people that reside within them. The people inside the enclaves were able to trave in and out of them freely, but with such neglect in the general region it was often seen as futile to do so. Because of this, people in the enclaves faced worse conditions than the rural areas that surrounded them.
