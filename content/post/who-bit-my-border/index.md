# My Notes

The border the defines New Guinea, west and east, seems balance perfectly

- But zoom in close enough, and that balance disappears

- Why is that tiny indentation there?

Raids in the south required action from the British, but room for maneuver was complicated by the dubious border of the then-dutch west of New Guinea

The problem was solved by moving the border south of the fly river slightly to the East.

It made it easier to police the region

The border also made the distinction of the Oceanic continent a bit easier as well

Varies from all the masses between Asia and America to just Polynesia, Micronesia, and Melanesia

So: Papua New Guinea is part of Oceania, Western New Guinea, being Indonesian, is part of Asia

Fly river is the only other intercontinental border besides the Ural River between Asia and Europe.

Confusion about the Zaragoza Line and Tordesillas Line, how does that tie into the 141st Meridian? arent they very far geographically?

The Dutch eventually kicked out the Portuguese from the Moluccas (Mulaku Islands), but they kept tiny East Timor (until 1975, when indonesia dominated the tiny half-island)

- The East Timorese gained independence in 2002

The Island was saved from colonialism by its incredibly impermeable geography (dense forests)

Although tensions between indonesia and seperatist movements in Western New Guinea have relatively ceased after treaties in 1979 and 1986, the “seemingly straight borderline between the two papuas continues to mark the edge of countries, continents and conflicts”
