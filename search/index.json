[{"content":"For this analysis, we will look into the Civil war in Somalia, beginning with a brief history of the war.\nThroughout the colonial 20th century, modern-day Somalia was governed effectively by three different colonial powers. The British held control of modern-day Somaliland, and Italy held control of mainland Somalia. French Northern Somalia gained independence in 1977 as Djibouti. The French aren’t really big players in this, so we won’t talk about them much for now. In 1960, Italian and British Somalia united. In 1969, Mohamed Siad Barre came to power in Somalia after a military coup. He’s important, don’t forget his name (Hereinafter ‘Siad’). Siad held a firm image for a “Greater Somalia” which incorporated ethnic Somalis in the Ogaden region of (eastern) Ethiopia, Northern Somalia, and Northern Kenya, leading too many conflicts in the 70s \u0026amp; 80s. Siad was also a firm socialist, nationalized industries, and received great praise from the Soviet Union. In the wake of a stunning defeat for Somalia in the Ogaden war against Ethiopia, a massive drought and migrant crisis, as well as several other internal Liberation conflicts that weakened Barre’s regime, he was overthrown and forced to leave the country in 1991, the official start of the Somali Civil War. The power gap left by Siad Barre, combined with powerful regional clan warlords, and a complete failure of the UN to aid in the humanitarian crisis and “government building,” left the country ripe for the civil conflict that has ensued today.\nThe importance pretense to the United Nations mission in Somalia is the goal of the missions. The centralized government of Siad Barre collapsed in 1991, and since then, primary efforts have been taken to unite Somalia’s government and aid in its humanitarian issues. After the Ogaden war, the Soviet Union and the United States (previously backing Ethiopia) switched sides. Now the United States was in support of Somalia, and all future correspondence of the UN in Somalia occurred with the US. Somalia’s current government forms under an institutional form of identity politics, where appointments and “elections” happen under the pretense of clan allegiances, and not merit. This also makes foreign missions in Somalia incredibly difficult. In order to conduct missions, consulates, embassies, and bases need to be constructed, and centralized governments need to be cooperated with. However, the decentralized nature of the current Somalian government provides a steep obstacle.\nIn 1992, UN resolutions 733 \u0026amp; 746 were passed, and UNOSOM I (United Nations Operation in Somalia) was created. It was largely ineffective, had a lack of funding, and did not successfully aid the humanitarian crisis, as over 300,000 people died of starvation in 1993. UNOSOM I had the goal of deploying 4,000 troops, but only 1,000 were fully mobilized due to local warlords that made moving beyond Mogadishu(the capital of Somalia) difficult. However, in December 1992,* resolution 749* was passed. This created UNITAF, a coalition of states in the UN peacekeeping force, primarily the US. UNITAF undoubtedly had more success than UNOSOM I. It had greater state backing and the approval of regional warlords. UNITAF simply wanted to temporarily engage in humanitarian aid and peacekeeping forces, and in that respect, succeeded quite well. In the wake of the short-lived success of UNITAF, the UN aspired to revise UNOSOM I in what became* UNOSOM II* in 1993.\nThis new mission had 1.6$ billion in funds, and its goals were much more ambitious than UNITAF. UNOSOM II was tasked with not only peacekeeping and humanitarian aid but also the disarming of civilians and the creation of a new stable government. The ambitions of UNOSOM II were massive, but the details of the mission were unclear, and consent was not given by local Warlords. In 1994, the US left Somalia outright after negative public sentiment following the deaths of troops. The UN left Somalia outright in 1995, with no new government, and domestic divides that were exacerbated.\nWe now take a glimpse into the current situation in Somalia and prospects for the future.\nThe total failure of UNOSOM I \u0026amp; II meant that the UN was extremely reluctant to step in Rwanda in 1994, a tragedy leading to the death of almost a million civilians. Somalia proper became a breeding ground for Jihadists, warlords, and foreign and domestic separatists, all of which create a faint look into the future of the country. British Somaliland has made a swift recovery, however. They have undergone large infrastructure strides and developed a functioning autonomous government. The UN currently has no involvement in Somalia, but has set up outposts in Kenya that are used to monitor Somalia from afar. What seems to be most successful for Somalia, and what will allow it to maintain domestic peace in the future, is if nations within it continue to express autonomy. The aforementioned Somaliland was first, but Puntland, Jubaland, and Galmudug all have professed autonomy. It is fair to say that because of a lack of funding, as well as the inability to cooperate with the complex regional ethnic groups, foreign interference has done little to aid the situation in Somalia, but perhaps recognizing the independence of nations within Somalia will redeem it on the global stage as the powerful “Horn of Africa.”\n","date":"2022-10-27T21:04:00Z","image":"https://benicio.romashov.dev/p/why-did-the-un-fail-in-somalia-a-brief-history-and-analysis/cover_hu2e55c3aae6f8735e96dff4702e4dee7e_538653_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://benicio.romashov.dev/p/why-did-the-un-fail-in-somalia-a-brief-history-and-analysis/","title":"Why did the UN fail in Somalia?
